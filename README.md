This is a video calling application built using WebRTC, React, and Socket.IO. It allows users to have video chats, screen sharing, and chat with other participants. Here is a brief README file to help you understand the application and its features.

Features:

    Video Chat: The application enables users to have real-time video conversations with other participants. It utilizes WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology to establish peer-to-peer connections for video streaming.

    Screen Sharing: Users can share their screens during a video call, allowing others to view their desktop or a specific application window. This feature is particularly useful for presentations, demonstrations, or collaborative work.

    Chat Implementation: The application includes a chat feature, allowing participants to exchange messages while on a video call. This can be used for additional communication or sharing important information during the call.

    React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a modular and efficient approach to develop interactive and dynamic components.

    Socket.IO: The application uses Socket.IO, a JavaScript library that enables real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers. Socket.IO provides seamless integration with WebRTC and facilitates the exchange of messages, signaling, and other necessary information during video calls.
